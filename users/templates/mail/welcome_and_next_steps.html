                    <p>
                        Great to have you onboard! Best way to get started is to join our community meeting first tuesday of the month or weekly open house every tuesday. It is also highly recommendable to join our communication channels (Matrix, Telegram or IRC and email list). Be happy to ask if you like to know more!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Payment info</h2>
                    <p>Your personal bank reference number is <b>{{user.reference_number}}</b>. Remember always to use
                        your reference number</p>
                    <p>We will be wating your first payment before we add your account access in to the systems. Before this you can join our community meetings, open house and communication channels and ask if someone could help you. All Hacklab services work by voluntary basis so things might not work always. Please be patient. For the challenges help would be appreciated and we would be more than happy for your contribution. </p>
